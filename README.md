# BackLogAI

**An Intelligent Backlog Generator & Prioritization System**

## 1. What is BackLogAI?
BackLogAI is an automated, intelligent system designed to transform raw product inputs—such as user research, sales requests, and strategic goals—into structured, prioritized product backlogs ready for JIRA import. It uses Generative AI to ensure every story meets INVEST criteria and aligns with business goals.

## 2. Why BackLogAI?
Product Managers often struggle to balance competing demands from sales, engineering, and users. BackLogAI enforces a disciplined approach to backlog creation by filtering every feature request through **Five Key Pillars**:

1.  **User Value** (Solving genuine pain points)
2.  **Commercial Impact** (Revenue & deal blockers)
3.  **Strategic Horizon** (Long-term market relevance)
4.  **Competitive Positioning** (differentiation vs. catch-up)
5.  **Technical Reality** (Feasibility & debt)

**The Golden Rule:**
Every backlog item generated by this system answers three critical questions:
*   **Why now?** (Urgency)
*   **Why this?** (Value)
*   **Why us?** (Strategic Fit)

## 3. How It Works
BackLogAI operates as a modular system:
1.  **Input:** Accepts multi-modal inputs (text, ROI data, competitor analysis).
2.  **Process:**
    *   **Story Generation Engine:** Uses LLMs (OpenAI/Claude) to draft stories in standard user story format (`As a... I want... So that...`) with Acceptance Criteria (`Given/When/Then`).
    *   **Prioritization Engine:** Scores stories using RICE, WSJF, and MoSCoW frameworks.
    *   **Validation:** Checks stories against the INVEST quality model.
3.  **Output:**
    *   A clean, ranked backlog.
    *   Direct integration with JIRA (Epics, Stories, Tasks).
    *   A cross-platform UI (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web) for management.

## 4. Key Features
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** Context-aware story creation from brief descriptions.
*   **Smart Prioritization:** Automated scoring based on weighted business pillars.
*   **JIRA Sync:** Seamless API integration to push/pull issues.
*   **Multi-Platform UI:** Native experience on Mobile, Desktop, and Web via Kotlin Multiplatform.
